# Flight-Delays-Kaggle

Integrated three datasets (airlines.csv, airports.csv, flights.csv) from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays/ to create a new dataset, preserving the original data. Outliers were identified and addressed, and feature engineering was performed to enhance analysis. Key tasks and grading criteria:

Implementation
1. Data Integration:
Proper integration of airlines, airports, and flights datasets.
Original datasets remain intact.
2. Outlier Handling:
Identification and treatment of outliers.
3. Feature Engineering:
Creation of multiple features.
4. Analysis

This notebook serves as a comprehensive documentation of the data integration, outlier handling, and feature engineering processes.
